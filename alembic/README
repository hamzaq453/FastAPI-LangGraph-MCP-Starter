# FastAPI + LangGraph + MCP Starter

Add `alembic/` to your `.gitignore` if you want to exclude migration files from version control, or keep them if you want to track database schema changes.

## Alembic Usage

### Create a new migration
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback migrations
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Important Notes

- Make sure your DATABASE_URL uses `postgresql+asyncpg://` (not `postgresql://` or `postgresql+psycopg2://`)
- The `env.py` file is configured to work with async SQLAlchemy and SQLModel
- Migrations are automatically generated based on SQLModel models in `app/db/models.py`
